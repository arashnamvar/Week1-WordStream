			<p>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click (PPC) Marketing<p>
			<p><strong>PPC</strong>(<a href="">pay-per-click</a>)search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirments for PPC optimization:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>PPC Automation -</strong>White it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of <a href="">pay-per-click advertising</a>, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able to produce an amount of work that woould otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</li>
					<li><strong>PPC Management -</strong><a href="">PPC management</a> refers to the maintenance and prioritization of <a href="">paid search</a> marketing tasks.
